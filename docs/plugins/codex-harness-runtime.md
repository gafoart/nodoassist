Runtime contract for Codex harness turns. For setup and routing, see
[Codex harness](/plugins/codex-harness). For config fields, see
[Codex harness reference](/plugins/codex-harness-reference).

## Overview

Codex owns the native model loop, native thread resume, native tool
continuation, and native compaction. NodoAssist owns channel routing, session
files, visible message delivery, NodoAssist dynamic tools, approvals, media
delivery, and a transcript mirror around that boundary.

Prompt routing follows the selected runtime, not just the provider string. A
native Codex turn gets Codex app-server developer instructions; an explicit
NodoAssist compatibility route keeps the normal NodoAssist system prompt even when
it uses Codex-flavored OpenAI auth or transport.

NodoAssist starts and resumes native Codex threads with Codex's built-in
personality disabled (`personality: "none"`) so workspace personality files
and NodoAssist agent identity stay authoritative. Native Codex keeps Codex-owned
base/model instructions and project-doc loading otherwise. Lightweight
NodoAssist runs (for example cron) still suppress project-doc loading.

NodoAssist developer instructions cover NodoAssist runtime concerns: source-channel
delivery, NodoAssist dynamic tools, ACP delegation, adapter context, and the
active agent workspace profile files. Skill catalogs and tool-routed
`MEMORY.md` pointers are projected as turn-scoped collaboration developer
instructions. When memory tools are unavailable, active `BOOTSTRAP.md` content
and full `MEMORY.md` fall back to plain turn input context instead.

## Thread bindings and model changes

When an NodoAssist session is attached to an existing Codex thread, the next
turn resends the currently selected model, approval policy, sandbox,
approvals reviewer, and service tier to app-server. Switching from
`openai/gpt-5.5` to `openai/gpt-5.2` keeps the thread binding but asks Codex to
continue with the newly selected model.

## Visible replies and heartbeats

Direct/source chat turns through the Codex harness default to automatic final
assistant delivery for internal WebChat surfaces, matching the Pi harness
contract: the agent replies normally and NodoAssist posts the final text to the
source conversation. Set `messages.visibleReplies: "message_tool"` to keep
final assistant text private unless the agent calls `message(action="send")`.

Codex heartbeat turns get `heartbeat_respond` in the searchable NodoAssist tool
catalog by default so the agent can record whether the wake should stay quiet
or notify. Heartbeat initiative guidance is sent as a Codex collaboration-mode
developer instruction scoped to the heartbeat turn; ordinary chat turns stay
in Codex Default mode. When `HEARTBEAT.md` is non-empty, the heartbeat
instructions point Codex at the file instead of inlining its contents.

## Hook boundaries

| Layer                                 | Owner                      | Purpose                                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NodoAssist plugin hooks               | NodoAssist                 | Product/plugin compatibility across NodoAssist and Codex harnesses. |
| Codex app-server extension middleware | NodoAssist bundled plugins | Per-turn adapter behavior around NodoAssist dynamic tools.          |
| Codex native hooks                    | Codex                      | Low-level Codex lifecycle and native tool policy from Codex config. |

NodoAssist does not use project or global Codex `hooks.json` files to route
plugin behavior. For the native tool and permission bridge, NodoAssist injects
per-thread Codex config for `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`,
and `Stop`.

When Codex app-server approvals are enabled (`approvalPolicy` is not
`"never"`), the default injected native hook config omits `PermissionRequest`
so Codex's app-server reviewer and NodoAssist's approval bridge handle real
escalations after review. Add `permission_request` to
`nativeHookRelay.events` to force the compatibility relay anyway. Other Codex
hooks such as `SessionStart` and `UserPromptSubmit` remain Codex-level
controls; they are not exposed as NodoAssist plugin hooks in the v1 contract.

For NodoAssist dynamic tools, NodoAssist executes the tool after Codex asks for
the call, so plugin and middleware behavior runs in the harness adapter. For
Codex-native tools, Codex owns the canonical tool record; NodoAssist can mirror
selected events but cannot rewrite the native thread unless Codex exposes that
through app-server or native hook callbacks.

Codex app-server report-mode `PreToolUse` events defer plugin approval to the
matching app-server approval. If an NodoAssist `before_tool_call` hook returns
`requireApproval` while the native payload sets `nodoassist_approval_mode:
"report"`, the native hook relay records the plugin approval requirement and
returns no native decision. When Codex later sends the app-server approval
request for the same tool use, NodoAssist opens the plugin approval prompt and
maps the decision back to Codex. Codex `PermissionRequest` events are a
separate approval path and can still route through NodoAssist approvals when
configured for that bridge.

Codex app-server item notifications also provide async `after_tool_call`
observations for native tool completions not already covered by the native
`PostToolUse` relay. These are telemetry/compatibility only; they cannot
block, delay, or mutate the native tool call.

Compaction and LLM lifecycle projections come from Codex app-server
notifications and NodoAssist adapter state, not native Codex hook commands.
`before_compaction`, `after_compaction`, `llm_input`, and `llm_output` are
adapter-level observations, not byte-for-byte captures of Codex's internal
request or compaction payloads.

Codex native `hook/started` and `hook/completed` app-server notifications are
projected as `codex_app_server.hook` agent events for trajectory and
debugging. They do not invoke NodoAssist plugin hooks.

| Native tool argument mutation                       | Codex native pre-tool hooks can block, but NodoAssist does not rewrite Codex-native tool arguments.                                               | Requires Codex hook/schema support for replacement tool input.                            |
| Editable Codex-native transcript history            | Codex owns canonical native thread history. NodoAssist owns a mirror and can project future context, but should not mutate unsupported internals. | Add explicit Codex app-server APIs if native thread surgery is needed.                    |
| `tool_result_persist` for Codex-native tool records | That hook transforms NodoAssist-owned transcript writes, not Codex-native tool records.                                                           | Could mirror transformed records, but canonical rewrite needs Codex support.              |
| Rich native compaction metadata                     | NodoAssist can request native compaction, but does not receive a stable kept/dropped list, token delta, completion summary, or summary payload.   | Needs richer Codex compaction events.                                                     |
| Compaction intervention                             | NodoAssist does not let plugins or context engines veto, rewrite, or replace native Codex compaction.                                             | Add Codex pre/post compaction hooks if plugins need to veto or rewrite native compaction. |
| Byte-for-byte model API request capture             | NodoAssist can capture app-server requests and notifications, but Codex core builds the final OpenAI API request internally.                      | Needs a Codex model-request tracing event or debug API.                                   |

## Native permissions and MCP elicitations

For `PermissionRequest`, NodoAssist only returns explicit allow or deny
decisions when policy decides. A no-decision result is not an allow: Codex
treats it as no hook decision and falls through to its own guardian or user
approval path.

Codex app-server approval modes omit this native hook by default. This
applies unless `permission_request` is explicitly included in
`nativeHookRelay.events` or a compatibility runtime installs it.

When an operator chooses `allow-always` for a Codex native permission
request, NodoAssist remembers that exact provider/session/tool input/cwd
fingerprint for a bounded session window. The remembered decision is
intentionally exact-match only: a changed command, arguments, tool payload, or
cwd creates a fresh approval.

Codex MCP tool approval elicitations route through NodoAssist's plugin approval
flow when Codex marks `_meta.codex_approval_kind` as `"mcp_tool_call"`. Codex
`request_user_input` prompts are sent back to the originating chat, and the
next queued follow-up message answers that native server request instead of
being steered as extra context. Other MCP elicitation requests fail closed.

For the general plugin approval flow that carries these prompts, see
[Plugin permission requests](/plugins/plugin-permission-requests).

## Queue steering

Active-run queue steering maps onto Codex app-server `turn/steer`. With the
default `messages.queue.mode: "steer"`, NodoAssist batches steer-mode chat
messages for the configured quiet window and sends them as one `turn/steer`
request in arrival order.

Codex review and manual compaction turns can reject same-turn steering. In
that case, NodoAssist waits for the active run to finish before starting the
prompt. Use `/queue followup` or `/queue collect` when messages should queue
by default instead of steering. See [Steering queue](/concepts/queue-steering).

## Codex feedback upload

When `/diagnostics [note]` is approved for a session on the native Codex
harness, NodoAssist also calls Codex app-server `feedback/upload` for relevant
Codex threads, including logs for each listed thread and spawned Codex
subthreads when available.

The upload goes through Codex's normal feedback path to OpenAI servers. If
Codex feedback is disabled in that app-server, the command returns the
app-server error. The completed diagnostics reply lists the channels,
NodoAssist session ids, Codex thread ids, and local `codex resume <thread-id>`
commands for the threads that were sent.

If you deny or ignore the approval, NodoAssist does not print those Codex ids
and does not send Codex feedback. The upload does not replace the local
Gateway diagnostics export. See [Diagnostics export](/gateway/diagnostics) for
the approval, privacy, local bundle, and group-chat behavior.

Use `/codex diagnostics [note]` only when you want the Codex feedback upload
for the currently attached thread without the full Gateway diagnostics
bundle.

## Compaction and transcript mirror

When the selected model uses the Codex harness, native thread compaction
belongs to Codex app-server. NodoAssist does not run preflight compaction for
Codex turns, replace Codex compaction with context-engine compaction, or fall
back to NodoAssist or public OpenAI summarization when native compaction cannot
be started. NodoAssist keeps a transcript mirror for channel history, search,
`/new`, `/reset`, and future model or harness switching.

Explicit compaction requests, such as `/compact` or a plugin-requested manual
compact operation, start native Codex compaction with `thread/compact/start`.
NodoAssist keeps the request and shared-client lease open until Codex emits the
matching `contextCompaction` completion item and then reports the compaction
turn as completed. If that terminal turn exceeds the configured compaction
timeout, NodoAssist requests a native turn interrupt. The lease and per-thread
compaction fence remain held until Codex reports terminal state or confirms
the interrupt RPC. If Codex does not confirm within the interrupt grace
period, NodoAssist retires the connection before releasing the fence. Remote
connections also detach the matching thread binding so later work cannot
overlap an unconfirmed remote turn. Other turns on a retired connection fail
and can retry on a fresh client. Client closure, request cancellation, or a
failed compaction turn returns a failed operation. Automatic context-pressure
compaction is Codex's job; NodoAssist only starts native compaction for manually
requested triggers.

When a context engine requests Codex thread-bootstrap projection, NodoAssist
projects tool-call names and ids, input shapes, and redacted tool-result
content into the fresh Codex thread. It does not copy raw tool-call argument
values into that projection.

The mirror includes the user prompt, final assistant text, and lightweight
Codex reasoning or plan records when the app-server emits them. NodoAssist
records the native compaction start and terminal status, but it does not
expose a human-readable compaction summary or an auditable list of which
entries Codex kept after compaction.

Because Codex owns the canonical native thread, `tool_result_persist` does
not rewrite Codex-native tool result records. It only applies when NodoAssist
writes an NodoAssist-owned session transcript tool result.

## Media and delivery

NodoAssist continues to own media delivery and media provider selection. Image,
video, music, PDF, TTS, and media understanding use matching provider/model
settings such as `agents.defaults.imageGenerationModel`,
`videoGenerationModel`, `pdfModel`, and `messages.tts`.

Text, images, video, music, TTS, approvals, and messaging-tool output continue
through the normal NodoAssist delivery path; media generation does not require
the legacy runtime. When Codex emits a native image-generation item with a
`savedPath`, NodoAssist forwards that exact file through the normal reply-media
path even if the Codex turn has no assistant text.
